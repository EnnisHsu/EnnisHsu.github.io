# Education Experience
**Bachelor - South China University of Technology**
- Undergraduate Thesis : Fine-grained Classification of Bone Marrow Cells Using Deep Learning **advisor : prof. Weining Wang**
    - Utilized the Pytorch framework
    - Evaluate and contrast three cell classification algorithmic models: the [Resnet50](https://github.com/EnnisHsu/Cell_Resnet.git), Pairwise Interaction Network, and the Attention Pyramid Model
    - Conducted an analysis of diverse data augmentation strategies, encompassing conventional methods, [Progressive GAN](https://github.com/EnnisHsu/progressive-gan-pytorch.git),and [Style GAN2](https://github.com/EnnisHsu/stylegan2-ada-pytorch.git), to ascertain their impact on model performance.

    - Pyramid Model with the advanced features of Style GAN2, culminating in an improvement in the fine-grained classification accuracy of bone marrow cells

- SCUT Robotics Lab - RoboMaster National University Student Robot Competition **advisor : prof. Dong Zhang**
    - chief developer of Engineer Robot and [Robot with Manipulator](https://github.com/EnnisHsu/21_TigerArm/commits/dev/)
    - Implemented motion control for the robots chassis and upper structures using CAN and serial communication protocols combined with cascaded control systems.
    - Utilized [Coppeliasim simulations](https://github.com/EnnisHsu/20_VREP_Engineer.git) and finite state machine algorithms for automating the ammunition reloading process.
    -  Achieved simulation of the six degrees of freedom in the robotic arm's joint movements using a combination of Coppeliasim simulations and Matlab computation
    - Enhanced the arm's motion smoothness using cascaded control systems and polynomial interpolation algorithms.

- Computer Vision-Based Study Room Seat Availability System 
    - Chief developer in vision detection
    - Applied the YOLOv4 model for object detection, training the model to accurately identify occupied and available seats.
    - Integrated detection results into a database, which were then displayed on a mobile application, providing users with real-time information about seat availability.
